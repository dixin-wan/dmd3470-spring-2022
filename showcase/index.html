            <H1>Is Polyfill needed?</H1>   
            <p> whether or not this technology will work in modern browsers and if it requires polyfills or fallbacks. There is a great polyfill though, called Picturefill, which will buy you full IE 9-11 support. that none of this stuff breaks to the point of not displaying any image at all in non-supporting browsers, assuming you have an &lt;img src=&quot;&quot; alt=&quot;&quot;&gt; in there somewhere You can make your image sources reflect that by default and build out from there.</p>

            <H1>fill function</H1>   
            <p>Another perfectly legit goal with responsive images is not just to serve different sizes of the same image, but to serve different images. For example, cropping an image differently depending on the size of the screen and differences in the layout. This is referred to as “art direction.”
                The &lt;picture&gt; element is also used for fallback image types and any other sort of media query switching (e.g. different images for dark mode). You get greater control of what browsers display. </p>
